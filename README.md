# My personal website

### I started building this website to explore and familiarise myself with some frontend tools. This was written from scratch, following a bunch of tutorials, guides as well as inspecting portfolio websites done by my peers.

## Some important links that I used:

- Generic icons by [IconScout](https://iconscout.com/)
- Dev tools icons by [Devicon](https://devicon.dev/)
- Touch slider by [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/)
- Icons for tabs by [Favicon](https://favicon.io/)
- Fonts by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Background remover by [PicWish](https://picwish.com/)
